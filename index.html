            <img class="card-image-left float-left" Style="width: 200px; margin-right: 20px;" src="assets/images/headshot1.JPG" alt="Tysheba Morgan Headshot">  
            <p class="card-text pull-right">My Name is Tysheba L. Morgan.  I was born on December 13th, 1974 in Cleveland, Ohio. My parents are Tyrone Morgan and Frances Elizabeth Gregley.  I am the third child of six - four girls and two boys.</p>   
            <p>I graduated from Howard Univerty with a Masters in Finance.  I've always loved to work with numbers. I was good in math as a child so I studied accounting and finance in school. </p>
            <p>Just recently I started to realize I have a love for programming and fashion. I know the two don't mix.  I really started to appreciate technology and what programming can do while working in the finance and accounting profession. 
            In all the corporate jobs I have had, my proudest accomplishments are those where I used technology to make processes simpler and more efficient.  
            Whether I created a nice Excel Spreadsheet with impressive macros, an Access Database program, or worked with an in-house geek to create a custom program; I have enjoyed the process of creating something.  
            </p>
            <p>On the fashion side - I am the co-owner of a boutique called Charm City Boutique located in the University area of Charlotte, North Carolina. My boyfriend and I love to buy clothes from all over the world,
            put outfits together, and sell them.  We also love being entrepenuers.  Our goal is to retire young and rich.
